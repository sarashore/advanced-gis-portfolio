This my portfolio for 90753 - Advanced GIS!

# About Me
I'm a second-year MSPPM interested in education and housing policy. Before Heinz, I worked as an 11th Grade English Teacher and then at an education non-profit focused on improving access to higher education and guidance on the application and financial counseling. Since being at CMU, I've worked at Allegheny County DHS, Mullin & Lonergan, and now the URA. When I grow up, I'd like to work for a state department of education to create policies surrounding the intersection of food, housing, and education for students in K-12. In another life, I would have liked to have been a geologist studying volcanic eruptions. Outside of school, I enjoy gardening, rock climbing, relearning Spanish, and snuggling with my newish puppy. 

# What I Hope to Learn
GIS has been my favorite skill that I've learned at Heinz so far. In the last few months, I've used GIS to map housing needs for counties accross the country to submit to HUD; industrial hemp processing site locations in Fayette County, PA; and to create a cluster analysis for risk assessment of all 6-12 schools in the Pittsburgh School District. One thing I still hope to learn in this class is how to make client dashboards. Additionally, I'd like to become more comfortable with GitHub. I only learned about the resource on the first day of this class and now I'm seeing and hearing about it EVERYWHERE!
